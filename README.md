## Hello Dearest Darling, I'm Patrick ... ðŸ‘‹

### I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in strategy and management consultancy.

Currently, I am in search of a challenging work environment that fosters learning and constant feedback to further improve my (coding) skills. 

My Tech Stack includes: 
â€¢ JavaScript ES6, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3 
â€¢ React, Vue.js and Redux 
â€¢ Mapbox, Socket.io, Handlebars and jQuery
â€¢ Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL 
â€¢ AWS, Figma, Heroku and Git/GitHub
â€¢ Jest for Testing

Prior to that:
My experience as a Management Consultant at the in-house consultancy of a DAX30 company shaped me to be a problem solving, communicative and dedicated individual that knows the most valuable work is done when a team of multiple people strive to achieve a shared goal.

I had always a strong focus on Technology, Digitization and Innovation. This is reflected in my prior career stations at Deloitte Consulting, RÃ¶dl&Partner, PwC and Porsche Consulting as well as in my minor subject Informatics at TU Munich.
